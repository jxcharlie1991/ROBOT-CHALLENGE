# ROBOT-CHALLENGE
This challenge is implemented by C#, and it allows multiple robots placed on the table. 

[Code](https://github.com/jxcharlie1991/ROBOT-CHALLENGE)

Please download the coad, then open the file "ROBOT_CHALLENGE.sln".

The program needs user to input commands, thus the test samples are integrated into a document. Just copy the code, then paste a part into the program, then press the enter for testing. There are some [Test Samples](https://github.com/jxcharlie1991/ROBOT-CHALLENGE/blob/main/TEST/Test.md) for testing the program.

The class diahram could help understanding the object-oriented structure of this program.
